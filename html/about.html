                    Discrete Notes is an epic math hub for learning subject content with a variety of exercises and included solutions. The style of explanation is designed to be conversational and engaging, while also maintaining a basic level of mathematical rigor. As opposed to traditional methods of teaching, I try to provide an extra level of motivation to why the content is not only worthwhile, but interesting in its own right. Think of it as a fun textbook (I promise that's not an oxymoron!).

                    This site provides a special focus on content that students typically struggle with (e.g inverse trig functions, series convergence, and proofs)
