                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <div class = "paragraph">
                    Logic is foundational to all of mathematics, forming the basis by which new ideas are developed from old ones — the process of <em>proving</em> something. A strong understanding of formal logic not only improves mathematical skills, but problem-solving and common-sense skills in general. Many students tend to "hate" or at least dislike proofs, but the goal of this unit is to demonstrate that logic, deduction, and proof can be some of the most beautiful and intuitive parts of mathematics! 
                    <br><br>
                    We will begin with an introduction to boolean algebra and build gradually to formal logic—the language and underlying infrastructure of all of mathematics. Key ideas include true and false statements, logical operators, deductions, valid and invalid arguments, quantifiers, and proofs in general.
                    <br><br>
                    So, what is boolean algebra?
                    <br><br>
                    In regular algebra, we operated on numbers and quantities, and we solved things like $$2x + 3 = 11$$ We had an infinite number line (and coordinate-plane) to worry about. In <em>boolean</em> algebra however, we operate on <em>boolean</em> values (also commonly called truth-values), of which there are just 2 possible values! 
                </div>
                <div class = "definition">
                    <h3 style = "text-align: center;">Boolean values (Logical operands)</h3>

                    0 &:= False \;\; \text{(Notated $F$)} \\ \\
                    1 &:= True \;\; \text{(Notated $T$)}
                    \end{align} 
                </div>
                <div class = "paragraph">
                    In algebra we combined numbers and variables with arithmetic operations:
                    \begin{align}
                    1 + 2 + 3 &&& y = mx + b && Ax^2 + Bx + C
                    \end{align}
                    Now we'll be forming equations using boolean values. These equations won't be telling us so much about quantities and numbers, but about  <em>truth values</em> - whether certain statements and combinations of statements are true or false. Instead of arithmetic operators like $+$ and $-$, we'll have logical operators like $\lor$, $\land$, $\neg$, $\oplus$, $\implies$, $\iff$

                    If someone tells you that they're married and have two children, you expect <em>both</em> of those things to be true (If even one of those things is false, then their entire statement is false ($F$) and they're lying to you!).

                    The important idea is that an $AND$ statement is only true when all of its operands are true (in conjunction). For instance, just like the statement $A \land B$ is only true when both $A$ and $B$ are true, the statement $$A \land B \land C \land \cdots \land Z$$ is only true when <em>all</em> of $A,B,C, \cdots, Z$ are true. Now, let's say for instance, that we know $A$ is false. Then we immediately know for a fact that the entire statement is false (even if all the other operands are true). This is because the only way such a statement is true is if <em>all</em> of its operands are true.

                        3) At least 90 pounds <br>

                    <br>
                    We can say that the roller coaster's elgibility criteria are a <em>conjunction</em> of $4$ seperate statements. If we let $E$ be your elgibility, then we can write the equation describing it as follows: 
                    
                    $$E = (\text{At least 10 years old}) \land (\text{At least 4 feet tall}) \land (\text{At least 90 pounds}) \land (\text{Not red-haired})$$

                    $E$ evaluates to $true$ when all of its operands are true—namely, when each individual statement applies to you, and is thus satisfied. For instance, if you fail to satisfy even $1$ condition, then your roller-coaster elgibility evaluates to $false$.

                    which will evaluate to $true$ if at least one of those things (operands) is satisfied. For instance, if you're blond-haired, then you can absolutely ride the roller coaster! This is is because being blonde-haired implies that your $\text{not red-haired}$, and thus you've satisfied condition $4$. Since you satisfy at least $1$ condition, then you immediately satisfy the entire statement. Whether or not you satisfy any of the other conditions is irrelevant, because we are now dealing with a disjunction, in which case only a single operand needs to be true in order the whole statement to be true.

                    Now we are ready for one of the most fundamental ideas in logic and, adjacently, all of mathematics - the implication. The implication, in its most naked form, is just a binary operator like $and$ and $or$! It has two inputs (operands) and one output (a truth-value). But the implication has much more conceptual depth and significance attached to it.

                    Unlike $And$, $Or$, and $Not$, this operator has a non-intuitive definition at first glance. Many students find the truth table for this operator quite confusing (and rightly so). Why is it defined this way? Why is an implication $true$ whenever <em>either</em> the hypothesis is $false$ or the conclusion is $true$? More importantly, why is it useful to define an implication this way? We will answer these questions now and continue to emphasize them as we move forward, because the concept of an implication is required to understand much of this course's later content, especially in the area of proofs. In fact, the entirety of formal logic and mathematics operate on various forms of implication. For instance, consider the solution to a typical high-school algebra problem:

                    $$\begin{align}
                    & \sqrt{x-3} = \frac{x}{4} \\
                    \implies& x-3 = \frac{x^2}{16} \\
                    \implies& x^2 - 16x + 48 = 0 \\
                    \implies& (x - 4)(x - 12) = 0 \\
                    \implies& x = 4 \;\; OR \;\; x = 12
                    \end{align}$$
                    
                    Each step in the solution is an implication itself, where the truth of the previous step <em>implies</em> the truth of the next step. When you write a proof or construct some form of argument, each step is the result of an implication. In grade school, when you "showed your work" on a math problem, what you were implicitly doing was writing down a series of implications. And, to partially quell your anxiety around the word "proof", just know that <em>proving</em> something is just another way to say "show your work"! (For instance, the provided solution to the equation above can be considered a complete <em>proof</em> of the solution).

                    So what is an <em>implication</em>?

                <div class = "paragraph">
                    In the broadest sense, an implication is just an $if$-$then$ statement of the form "if $p$, then $q$". This is another way to say that "$p$ implies $q$", but in mathematics it's notated as $p \implies q$.
                </div>
                <div class = "paragraph">
                    All that the statement $p \implies q$ means, is that <strong>if $p$ is true, then $q$ must also be true.</strong> A good way to think of it is that, $p$ being true <em>leads</em> to $q$ being true, or $p$ being true <em>forces</em> $q$ to be true.

                <div class = "paragraph">
                    For now, this is all you need to know about implications, because in order to fully understand why the truth-table is the way it is (which often leaves many students confused), it helps to first understand what <em>tautalogy</em>, <em>contingency</em> and <em>contradiction</em> mean, as well as what a <em>valid</em> and <em>invalid</em> argument is.

                        A <em>tautology</em> is a (usually compound) statement that is <em>always</em> true, regardless of the truth-valuation of its variables.

                    For example, here are a few tautalogies:
