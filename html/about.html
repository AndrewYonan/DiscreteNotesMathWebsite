                    Discrete Notes is an epic math hub for learning subject content with a variety of exercises and included solutions, inspired by my experiences with students as a math tutor. The style of explanation is designed to be intuitive, conversational, and example-driven, while also maintaining a basic level of mathematical rigor. As opposed to traditional methods of teaching, I try to provide an extra level of motivation to why the content is not only worthwhile, but interesting (and intuitive!) in its own right.

                    This site provides a special focus on content that 1) students typically struggle with and 2) often isn't taught very well (e.g inverse trig functions, series convergence, proofs, and formal logic) If a traditional textbook (which is great on its own) is your teacher, then consider this website your tutor!

                    Above all, this website is designed not only to show you the math, but to show you where it came from and why it's not magic. While math can be a difficult subject, my goal is to demonstrate that math isn't just a set of random and arbitrary rules (which is a mindset easily inspired by bad teaching), but that math can be <em>intuitive</em>, meaning that <em>you</em> could have created, from scratch, all the math covered on this website, by starting from basic principles (formally called axioms) and building on them.

                    For instance, students are often encouraged to memorize the quadratic formula with no additional context:
                    $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
                </div>
                <div class = "paragraph">
                    However, that very quadratic formula is just the solution you would obtain if you tried to solve the general quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ by completing the square. Thus, completing the square and solving the quadratic formula arne't actually seperate methods (as a typical high school course might lead a student to believe). Using the quadratic formula <em>is</em> completing the square, but you're just skipping to the last step and plugging the numbers in!
