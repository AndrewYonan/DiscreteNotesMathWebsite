                    Logic is foundational to all of mathematics, forming the basis by which new ideas are developed from old ones — the process of <em>proving</em> something. A strong understanding of formal logic not only improves mathematical skills, but problem-solving and common-sense skills in general. Many students tend to "hate" or at least dislike proofs, but the goal of this unit is to demonstrate that logic, deduction, and proof can be some of the most beautiful parts of mathematics! 
                    <br><br>
                    We will begin with an introduction to boolean algebra and build gradually to formal logic—the language and underlying infrastructure of all of mathematics. Key ideas include true and false statements, logical operators, deductions, valid and invalid arguments, quantifiers, and proofs in general.
                    <br><br>
                    So, what is boolean algebra?
                    <br><br>
                    In regular algebra, we operated on numbers and quantities, and we solved things like $$2x + 3 = 11$$ We had an infinite number line (and coordinate-plane) to worry about. In <em>boolean</em> algebra however, we operate on <em>boolean</em> values, of which there are just 2 possible values!
